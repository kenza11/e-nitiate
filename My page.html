<h1>The short story of an e-nitiator</h1>

<p>My name is Kenza Abdelhaq, I am 17 years old, from Casablanca and I go to Al Jabr high school. I am interested in many fields such as art and photography but I reckon that my real passion is for computer science. Indeed this was the main reason I participated in that summer camp, a fulfulling experience that allowed me to grow personnally and intellectually. I had the chance to expend my knowledge and broaden my horizons thanks to amazing teachers and dedicated volounteers, but also to meet new people from all around Morocco with whome I share the same interest. Glad I have been chosen and thanks again to this amazing team !! </p>
